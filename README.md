#### Executive summary
In a world in which concerns regarding to mental health and its disastrous consequences that are not limited to emotional, social and psicologial well being but also all the physcial problems related to it such as diabetes, heart diseases, ans strokes accordingly with the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
It is not an overstatement to say that mental health is critical for one's well being and for the overall society. However, dispite its importance more and more people are becoming addictive to legal and ilegal drugs causing distress and disruption in many families around the globe.
While resposible drug use is still critical for a health society some people has more tendency than others to abusive of such drugs. Becoming addictive to those substancies and leading them from one health issue to another devastating one.
Prevention is still the best approach to make sure we leverage the modern medicine drugs to cure our bodies at the same time preventing people that are more vulnerable to abusive of them.
Therefore, we hope with this study we can shed some light on the people traits and light drugs - such as choccolate, nicotine, etc - consumption behavior to predict who is more vulnerable to abusive heavy drugs - such as heroin, ecstasy, coke, etc.

#### Rationale
If medical professionals and mental care practioners know what leads a person to abuse drugs and who is vulnerable we can proactively provide doctors and family members a chance to prevent those people from becoming addicted to drugs. That, by itself can help create a better society and help individuals be mentally healthier in a world in which OPIODS and mental health are a growing concern. It is also good for health insurance companies that would not have to pay for drugs to patients that are abusing its usage.

#### Research Question
Can we predict who is vulnerable to be addicted drugs based on personality traits and light drug consumption usage such as caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, nicotine and others?

#### Data Sources
I will analyze the dataset provided by UC Irvine (UCI) called "Drug Consumption (Quantified)". This dataset contains records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified.

#### Methodology
In order to answer this important question I am going to use machine learning classification techniques to better understand the data and train a model that not only can help predict who is vulnerable to abuse of these drugs but also help better understand what are the leading factors that contribute to that.


#### Results
This study has achieved a signigicant predictive model with accuracy of 0.85 (out of a maximum of 1) which can help medical professional to predict patiences that might be more vulnerable to abuse of drugs. This is important because before prescribing a drug medical practictioners will be able to assess if the drug is additive and if the patience is vulnerable to abuse its usage. Therefore, reducing the number of people that have their lifes and their family lives destryoed due to that abuse.
To the question of what personal traits are more relevant to 


#### Next steps
The current data available for this study is not representative of the world since it is skewed in a lot of attributes such as country and ethnicity. Therefore, further study is recommended in a new set of data to confirm the below findings found by this research.

Considering the reliability of this data, it still raises the question what to do when a patience need a certain drug for legit medical purpose but is identified as someone that is vulnerable to drug abuse? Ideally, the medical professional should provide alternative treatment which treatments are the most effective? Should it be a single treatment for everyone or should every person have a tailored treatment based on their on personal traits assessment?
Further studying new data on treatments could help to expand the benefits of this study and improve the life quality of all vulnerable people.
